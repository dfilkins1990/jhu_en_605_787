    Download Font Awesome. Once you click ‘Download’, you can simply choose ‘No thanks, just download Font Awesome’ 
    option). Once you download and unzip the package, use the directions on their Getting Started page under the heading 
    Using CSS to install it into your index.html page.

    Notes:
    Downloaded Font Awesome 5 as it was the one available on the website.
    Could not locate the reference "Using CSS to install it into your index.html page."
    Added the "webfonts" folder to the root directory and the "all.min.css" file to the css folder and index.html

<!--2c.
    In the about.html snippet (or partial as it’s sometimes called), create 5 span tags with empty content. 
    How you choose to position them in the page is up to you. They just have to be all in a row (not stacking). 
    Each span will have a class attribute with a property we’ll substitute later using our insertProperty function. 
    So, the first one should be <span class=""></span>, the second one should be <span class=""></span>, and so on 
    until the last, 5th one.

<span class=""></span>
<span class=""></span>

    An empty star should have its class value be class="fa fa-star-o". A filled star should have its class value be 
    class="fa fa-star". The empty star, if any, should be the last one in the list.

    NOTES: 
    I downloaded Font Awesome 5 and the classes are a little different.
    The class must be "far fa-star" for an emtpy star and "fas fa-star" for a full star.
